TESTIMONIALS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Internship Session was good. We learnt many Interesting things that are useful from career point of view. The Interviews arranged were good & useful for us. We came to know many things & will try to improve on our drawbacks. The overall internship was helping & very good.

This was my first Internship and had an excellent experience. The staff was well versed in technology, friendly and helpful. Got a lot of different information in Electronics too.

I am satisfied with SunBeam’s Internship. My experience was very good and project team leads are also so talented and helpful. This internship also gave me knowledge for Interviews and inputs on how to work in company.

Excellent teaching style and excellent understanding of teaching topics. I like the most about the course is how Sandeep sir helps to improve visualization of code using proper diagrams and images. Also, proper sequencing of sample examples helps to revise the topic in the future. It’s good that sir gives more time on basic topics in the beginning so that the foundation is strong.

Sir, it’s been a great session with you. The way you taught is very good. It's my first time learning java language and I never felt left out at any point, thanks for taking up every basic topic.

There are two types of teachers, one who teach their students what the syllabus dictates and the other, who go beyond the coursework to teach their students things that life dictates. I really had a fantastic time taking your course. Start from the "Compiling Program without IDE to Reflection" I don’t owe my professional success to my destiny, courage, luck, belief, confidence, or fortune. I owe it to a wonderful scholar like you. Nothing can come close to the inspirational presence of an instructor like you in a student’s journey. You are a great trainer organized, responsive, patient, and able to clearly explain complex topics and nuances. Being so encouraging and doing everything you can to keep us motivated and supported throughout our program. Your knowledge and leadership provide us with a priceless model for our own careers. I am so happy you are part of my education. Thank you for teaching me that emotion and logic exist best together. I learned to truly care about diversity and inclusion through your classes, and I hopefully now spread that message in a passionate but thoughtful way. You’re awesome!

Excellent sessions by Sandeep Sir enjoyed learning core of the Java. Sandeep sir's way of teaching is excellent and easily understood by anyone. Considering the fact that Java is not that simple when it moves to its complex features to any beginner or who doesn't work on Java, it needs much more revisions and continued coding practice. Sandeep sir has made it very easy to understand and taught us exactly how to think in Java. And it clearly seen in the sessions how much hard work has to be done offline to create any notes and diagrams to make things simple and easily understandable. Thank you sir for conducting the sessions. Really looking forward to see you in next advance sessions.

I really appreciate the way sir explains any concept. It is really good. Please arrange such webinars even after lock down so that working people(those who don't have holiday on Saturday) can also attend such webinars.

Amit Sir, will be providing the videos on the missed topic which was something I liked the most. It shows his seriousness towards his teaching. He is such a great teacher who really wants the student to learn. Its not that he will teach just to cover the topics keeping the watch in front. I was really impressed by such a teaching skill and most importantly it was an online class and he was teaching so flawlessly . I would say it was the best online class I have ever attended. Thanks a lot Sir. You are so patient and awesome teacher. Respect for you.

It is always good to learn from Amit sir being an old sunbeam student. The session was very good and covered most of the aspects of javascript. As I work on javascript from last 5 years and I wanted to explore more about the internals at some extent that was missing for me. I enjoyed the session utilized my time and added some more concepts to my learning in a new way.
